SymPy is managed in a Mercurial repository. You can download it using:

hg clone http://hg.sympy.org/sympy/

We are sorry that you downloaded this svn repository. Unfortunately, the Google
Code Hosting doesn't allow us to put a link to our hg repository on the web
page (instead of this svn repository).
