#summary Changes in each release

= Introduction =

This page documents the major changes made to !SymPy since the last release.

== svn ==

Currently the same as 0.3.

== 0.3 ==

  * symbolic matrices (normal operations like `+`, `*`, dirac and pauli matrices)
  * Pauli algebra implemented using the NCSymbol class
  * polynomials (division, gcd, square free decomposition)
  * moved printing advanced stuff out of the core (see http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/PrintingMathML)
  * implemented slices on sympy's objects. Slices are now the recomended way to access all of sympy's nested objects. Examples: 
    * know the arguments of a function: `sin(x*y)[:] -- > (x*y,)`
    * arguments of Mul, Add, Pow, etc. : `(1+x)[:] --> (1,x)`
    * see also the new Basic.atoms function
  * Derivative and Limit class
  * easy usage (differentiation and other stuff) of unknown functions, see examples/relativity.py
  * complex numbers work for `exp(I*x)` and stuff. evalc() method 
  * Initial support for assumptions (for example: x = Symbol('x', is_real=True) )
  * a lot of refactorings and small fixes
  * debian package

== 0.2 ==

This is the first release.
