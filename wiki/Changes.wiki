#summary Changes in each release

= Introduction =

This page documents the major changes made to !SymPy since the last release.

== svn ==

  * currently the same as the 0.5.2 version

== 0.5.2 ==

  * concrete mathematics module written
  * geometry module
  * make the tarball conform to Debian policy
  * many small bugs fixed, see Issues for details
  * known issues: there are many problems in the limits module (needs to be refactored), but all tests pass correctly

== 0.5.1 ==

  * importing sympy (`import sympy`) was made a lot faster (2.4s against 0.1s)
  * known issues: there are many problems in the limits module (needs to be refactored), but all tests pass correctly

== 0.5.0 ==

  * new core (from 10x to 100x speedup compared to 0.4.3)
  * multivariate functions
  * pattern matching uses the Wild and !WildFunction classes (see the [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Tutorial Tutorial] for usage)
  * `numerics` module for fast arbitrary-precision numerical computations (much faster than the Python int and Decimal)
  * `plotting` module improved (colormaps, middle mouse button for zooming and more)
  * `sympy/modules/*` was moved to `sympy/*` and the `sympy/modules` directory was deleted
  * known issues: there are many problems in the limits module (needs to be refactored), but all tests pass correctly

== 0.4.3 ==

  * assumptions improved
  * plotting module uses pyglet (no more hangups) and more improvements
  * caching Rationals -1, 0, 1, resulting in 35% speedup of tests
  * closed and pretty forms for simple summations and products
  * new term rewriting functions: collect() and together()
  * enhanced solver of polynomial equations
  * preliminary support for binary arithmetics
  * more special functions (zeta, incomplete gamma etc.) 

== 0.4.2 ==

  * augmented matrix manipulation including 2d slicing
  * general matrix inversion
  * LU decomposition (& associated linear solver)
  * sparse matrix implementation via python dictionaries
  * hessian, jacobian of matrices, cross/dot products
  * QR decomposition & the Gram-Schmidt procedure
  * geometry module enhanced
  * factorization ( `factor(x**6-1)` )

== 0.4.1 ==

  * added `sympy.modules.plotting.renderables` and `sympy.modules.plotting.scene` modules

== 0.4.0 ==

  * determinants
  * groebner bases (initial implementation). multivariate division, gcd
  * Fraction free Gaussian elimination
  * resultant of polynomials
  * graphing support
  * geometry module
  * prime numbers
  * special functions (factorials)
  * renamed arguments is_commutative to commutative, is_dummy to dummy
  * MathML refactoring, renamed to __mathml__ and now uses xml.dom.minidom
  * ratsimp() for simplifying fractions added to sympy.modules.simplify
  * `exp(x+y).expand()` and `(exp(x)*exp(y)).combine()`, the same for `log`.
  * pretty printing
  * `infty` renamed to `oo`
  * Experimental plotting support via matplotlib
  * Removed class NCSymbol, use Symbol(name, is_commutative=False) instead
  * Matrix now (optionally) accepts a generating function: Matrix(2, 2, lambda i,j: i*j )
  * The class Order added
  * Pattern matching implemented (see the match() method)
  * A table of integrals implemented
  * Basic equations solving, algebraic (solve) and differential (dsolve)

== 0.3 ==

  * symbolic matrices (normal operations like `+`, `*`, dirac and pauli matrices)
  * Pauli algebra implemented using the NCSymbol class
  * polynomials (division, gcd, square free decomposition)
  * moved printing advanced stuff out of the core (see http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/PrintingMathML)
  * implemented slices on sympy's objects. Slices are now the recomended way to access all of sympy's nested objects. Examples: 
    * know the arguments of a function: `sin(x*y)[:] -- > (x*y,)`
    * arguments of Mul, Add, Pow, etc. : `(1+x)[:] --> (1,x)`
    * see also the new Basic.atoms function
  * Derivative and Limit class
  * easy usage (differentiation and other stuff) of unknown functions, see examples/relativity.py
  * complex numbers work for `exp(I*x)` and stuff. evalc() method 
  * Initial support for assumptions (for example: x = Symbol('x', is_real=True) )
  * a lot of refactorings and small fixes (the c() was renamed to Basic.sympify())
  * debian package

== 0.2 ==

This is the first release.
