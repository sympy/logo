== 0.5.6 ==

  * `_sage_()` methods implemented to convert any !SymPy expression to a SAGE expression.

  * issues fixed: 439, 436
  * known issues:
      * the series expansion fails for some more complex expressions (the same problem since !SymPy 0.5.0), see the relevant [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/list?can=2&q=%22series+bug%22 issues].

  * known issues:
      * the series expansion fails for some more complex expressions (the same problem since !SymPy 0.5.0), see the relevant [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/list?can=2&q=%22series+bug%22 issues].

== 0.5.4 ==

  * `Log` and `ApplyLog` classes were simplified to `log`, as was in the 0.4.3 version (the same for all other classes, like `sin`, `cos`, etc.), for the current uptodate documentation see SymPySvn.
  * limits algorithm was fixed and it works very reliably (there are some bugs in the series facility though that make some limits fail), see this [http://groups.google.com/group/sympy/browse_thread/thread/98a044bd5ac537ca post] for more details
  * all functions arguments are now accessed using the `sin(x)[:]` idiom again, as in the 0.4.3 version (instead of the old `sin(x)._args` or `sin(x).args` which was briefly introduced in the 0.5.x series), see SymPySvn, section _accessing parameters_
  * known issues:
      * the series expansion fails for some more complex expressions (the same problem since !SymPy 0.5.0), see this [http://groups.google.com/group/sympy/browse_thread/thread/98a044bd5ac537ca post] for more details
