This page documents the major changes made to !SymPy since the last release.

= Releases = 

== 0.3 ==

  * symbolic matrices (normal operations like `+`, `*`, dirac and pauli matrices)
  * NCSymbol class
  * moved printing advanced stuff out of the core (see http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/PrintingMathML)
  * implemented slices on sympy's objects. Slices are now the recomended way to access all of sympy's nested objects. Examples: 
    * know the arguments of a function: `sin(x*y)[:] -- > (x*y,)`
    * arguments of Mul, Add, Pow, etc. : `(1+x)[:] --> (1,x)`
    * see also the new atoms function

== 0.2 ==

This is the first release.
