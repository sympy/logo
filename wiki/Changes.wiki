      * the series expansion fails for some more complex expressions (the same problem since !SymPy 0.5.0), see the relevant [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/list?can=2&q=%22series+bug%22 issues].

== 0.5.4 ==

  * `Log` and `ApplyLog` classes were simplified to `log`, as was in the 0.4.3 version (the same for all other classes, like `sin`, `cos`, etc.), for the current uptodate documentation see SymPySvn.
  * limits algorithm was fixed and it works very reliably (there are some bugs in the series facility though that make some limits fail), see this [http://groups.google.com/group/sympy/browse_thread/thread/98a044bd5ac537ca post] for more details
  * all functions arguments are now accessed using the `sin(x)[:]` idiom again, as in the 0.4.3 version (instead of the old `sin(x)._args` or `sin(x).args` which was briefly introduced in the 0.5.x series), see SymPySvn, section _accessing parameters_
  * known issues:

== 0.5.1 ==

  * importing sympy (`import sympy`) was made a lot faster (2.4s against 0.1s)

     * the series expansion fails for some more complex expressions

== 0.5.0 ==

  * new core (from 10x to 100x speedup compared to 0.4.3)
  * multivariate functions
  * pattern matching uses the Wild and !WildFunction classes (see the [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Tutorial Tutorial] for usage)
  * `numerics` module for fast arbitrary-precision numerical computations (much faster than the Python int and Decimal)
  * `plotting` module improved (colormaps, middle mouse button for zooming and more)
  * `sympy/modules/*` was moved to `sympy/*` and the `sympy/modules` directory was deleted
  * known issues: 
     * there are many problems in the limits module (needs to be refactored), but all tests pass correctly (fixed in 0.5.4)
     * the series expansion fails for some more complex expressions

== 0.4.3 ==

  * assumptions improved
  * plotting module uses pyglet (no more hangups) and more improvements
  * caching Rationals -1, 0, 1, resulting in 35% speedup of tests
  * closed and pretty forms for simple summations and products
  * new term rewriting functions: collect() and together()
  * enhanced solver of polynomial equations
  * preliminary support for binary arithmetics
  * more special functions (zeta, incomplete gamma etc.) 

== 0.4.2 ==

  * determinants
  * groebner bases (initial implementation). multivariate division, gcd
  * Fraction free Gaussian elimination
  * resultant of polynomials
  * graphing support
  * geometry module
  * prime numbers
  * special functions (factorials)
  * renamed arguments is_commutative to commutative, is_dummy to dummy
  * MathML refactoring, renamed to __mathml__ and now uses xml.dom.minidom
  * ratsimp() for simplifying fractions added to sympy.modules.simplify
  * `exp(x+y).expand()` and `(exp(x)*exp(y)).combine()`, the same for `log`.
  * pretty printing
  * `infty` renamed to `oo`
  * Experimental plotting support via matplotlib
  * Removed class NCSymbol, use Symbol(name, is_commutative=False) instead
  * Matrix now (optionally) accepts a generating function: Matrix(2, 2, lambda i,j: i*j )

  * polynomials (division, gcd, square free decomposition)
  * moved printing advanced stuff out of the core (see http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/PrintingMathML)

    * know the arguments of a function: `sin(x*y)[:] -- > (x*y,)`
    * arguments of Mul, Add, Pow, etc. : `(1+x)[:] --> (1,x)`
    * see also the new Basic.atoms function
  * Derivative and Limit class
  * easy usage (differentiation and other stuff) of unknown functions, see examples/relativity.py
  * complex numbers work for `exp(I*x)` and stuff. evalc() method
