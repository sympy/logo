#summary Reasons to join SymPy development.

= Introduction =

So you are playing with the idea to become a !SymPy developer, but are not yet convinced? Well, here are some arguments to consider.

== Nice team ==

We are scattered all over the world and none of us has ever seen anyone else face to face (except Ondrej and Mateusz), so to become a developer is really as simple as contributing a good code. It's fun to work in a team.

== Your code gets to everyone ==

If you write some nice symbolic algorithm, then just by getting it to the !SymPy svn, it will later become a part of a release and then gets into the standard distributions of Debian, Ubuntu and Gentoo (if you use something else, we will be glad if you create a native package for your favourite linux distribution). So anyone using those systems can install !SymPy with only one command and it will just work, so you own code can then be easily used by a lot of people. And you just don't have to worry about it, the only thing you need to do is to commit it to !SymPy.
