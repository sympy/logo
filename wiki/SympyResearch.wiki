= O â€“ the domain of order terms (Landau symbols) =

  _O(f, x)_ represents the Landau symbol _O(f, x -> 0)_.

== Call ==

  O(f, x, y, ..)

== Parameters ==

  f --- an arithmetical expression representing a function in x, y, etc.
  x, y --- variables, assumed to be infinitesimal

== Return value ==

  an Order instance.

== Details ==

 * By mathematical definition, for a function f with variables x,y, .., the 
   Landau symbol g = O(f, x, y, ..) is a representative of a class of
   functions having the following property: there exists a constant M and
   a neighborhood of the limit point (0, 0, ..) such that |g| <= M|f|
   for all values (x,y,..) in that neighborhood.

 * If variables x,y,.. are not specified then all symbols in f are considered
   as order variables. Otherwise all other symbols in f except x,y,.. are
   considered as parameters.

 * The variables in Order instance can be accessed via .symbols attribute.

 * The expression in Order instance cab be accessed via .expr attribute.

 * Automatic simplification is applied. See examples.

== Examples ==

{{{
>>> x,y=map(Symbol,'xy')
>>> O(x)
O(x, x)
>>> O(3*x)
O(x, x)
>>> O(3*x+x**2)
O(x, x)
>>> O(3*x+1/x)
O(1 / x, x)
>>> O(exp(1/x)+1/x)
O(exp(1 / x), x)
>>> O(x+y)
O(x + y, x, y)
>>> O(x+x*y)
O(x, x)
}}}
