= O â€“ the domain of order terms (Landau symbols) =

  `O(f, x)` represents the Landau symbol _O(f, x -> 0)_.

== Call ==

  `O(f, x, y, ..)`

== Parameters ==

  `f` --- an arithmetical expression representing a function in x, y, etc.
  `x, y` --- variables, assumed to be infinitesimal

== Return value ==

  an Order instance or Zero instance.

== Details ==

 * According to the mathematical definition, for a function f with variables x,y, .., the  Landau symbol _g = O(f, x, y, ..)_ is a representative of a class of functions having the following property: there exists a constant M and a neighborhood of the limit point _(0, 0, ..)_ such that _|g| <= M|f|_ for all values _(x,y,..)_ in that neighborhood.

 * If variables `x, y, ..` are not specified then all symbols in `f` are considered as order variables. Otherwise all other symbols in `f` except `x, y, ..` are considered as parameters.

 * The variables in Order instance can be accessed via .symbols attribute.

 * The expression in Order instance can be accessed via .expr attribute.

 * The inclusion relation between _O(f, x)_ and _O(g, x)_ is determined by the result of `limit(f/g, x, 0)`. If the result is unbounded (e.g. `oo`) then _O(g, x)_ is a subset of _O(f, x)_ and `O(f+g,x)` results `O(f,x)`.

 * Automatic simplification is applied to O expression. See examples.

== Examples ==

{{{
>>> from sympy.core import *
>>> x,y=Symbol('x'), Symbol('y')
>>> O(x,x),O(3*x,x),O(x+x**2),O(x+1/x),O(x+1/x+exp(2/x))
(O(x, x), O(x, x), O(x, x), O(1 / x, x), O(exp(2 / x), x))
>>> O(x+y)
O(x + y, x, y)
>>> O(x+x*y)
O(x, x)
}}}
