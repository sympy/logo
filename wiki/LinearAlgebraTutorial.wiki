#summary Introduction to using Sympy's linear algebra module

= Introduction =

The Sympy linear algebra module is an easy-to-learn, functional library for matrix manipulation. The module includes the ability to use symbolic variables.

For a more general tutorial remember to read the general [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Tutorial Tutorial].

= Simple Manipulation =

The linear algebra module is deign to be as simple as possible. First we import and declare our first Matrix:
{{{
    >>> from sympy import *
    >>> from sympy.modules.matrices import Matrix
    >>> Matrix([[1,0], [0,1]]) #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE 
    1 0 
    0 1
}}}

This is the standard manner one creates a matrix, i.e. with a list of appropriately-sizes lists. SymPy also supports more advanced methods of matrix creation including a single list of values and dimension inputs:
{{{
>>> Matrix(2, 3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
}}}
