#summary How to install SymPy

!SymPy is packaged for the following systems, so if you use one of them, simply follow the instructions. Otherwise (or if you prefer), you can install the sources directly.

== Debian ==

Download the deb file from the project's homepage, and then install it with the command `"sudo dpkg -i python-sympy_$version_all.deb"`, where `$version` must be replaced with the version number. 

Hopefully, we'll soon (couple of weeks) have this package in the official debian main repository.

== Windows ==

Downlad the windows installer from the homepage and execute it.

== Sources ==

The only prerequisite is python 2.4 or newer.

=== latest release ===

On unix systems (linux, BSD, cygwin, etc.): Download the source archive (something like `sympy-0.3.tar.gz`), extract it with the command `"tar xvvzf sympy-0.3.tar.gz"` and follow the README located in the sympy directory.

=== svn version ===

On unix systems:
{{{
svn checkout http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sympy 
}}}


= Test it =

Test that !SymPy works:
{{{
cd sympy
cd examples
python basic.py
}}}

To test the whole !SymPy package, run `python setup.py test` in the `sympy` directory. You will need `py.test` that is part of the [http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html py lib]. If you use Debian, install the `python-codespeak-lib` package.
