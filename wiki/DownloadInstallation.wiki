#summary How to install SymPy

= Installation =

!SymPy is packaged for the following systems, so if you use one of them, simply follow the instructions. Otherwise (or if you prefer), you can install the sources directly.

== Debian ==

!SymPy is in Debian unstable and testing. The exact !SymPy versions in Debian can be seen  here: http://packages.debian.org/python-sympy

So just add the unstable (or testing) among your sources and
{{{
apt-get install python-sympy
}}}

== Ubuntu ==

!SymPy is in Gutsy. The exact !SymPy versions in Ubuntu can be seen here:  https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sympy

== Windows ==

Downlad the windows installer from the homepage and execute it.

== Sources ==

The only prerequisite is python 2.4 or newer. !SymPy optionally uses some other modules or packages, but they are optional. If you have problems using it on a pure Python installation, please report the problems into the Issues and we'll fix that.

=== latest release ===

On unix systems (linux, BSD, cygwin, etc.): Download the source archive (something like `sympy-0.4.0.tar.gz`), extract it with the command `"tar xzf sympy-0.4.0.tar.gz"` and follow the README located in the sympy directory.

=== svn version ===

On unix systems:
{{{
svn checkout http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sympy 
}}}


= Test it =

Test that !SymPy works:
{{{
cd sympy
cd examples
python basic.py
}}}

or using the example from the front page:
{{{
>>> from sympy import Symbol, cos
>>> x=Symbol('x')
>>> e=1/cos(x)
>>> print e.series(x,10)
1+1/2*x^2+5/24*x^4+61/720*x^6+277/8064*x^8+50521/3628800*x^10
}}}

To test the whole !SymPy package, run `python setup.py test` in the `sympy` directory. You will need `py.test` that is part of the [http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html py lib]. If you use Debian, install the `python-codespeak-lib` package. Note: you only need the standard Python 2.4 (or newer) to run all tests. If it doesn't work, please report the problem into the Issues.
