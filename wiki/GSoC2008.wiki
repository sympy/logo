#summary Information about the 2008 Google Summer of Code and SymPy

= Introduction =

If Google is going to do GSoC 2008, !SymPy is going to participate, the same way as in 2007 (see [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/GSoC2007 GSoC2007]).

Now it's time to get involved in the project - sign up to the !SymPy mailinglist, try to fix issues, send patches, simply let us know about yourself.
