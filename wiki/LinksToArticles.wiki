#summary Contains links to interesting articles about CAS

= Introduction =

There are many nice articles explaining CAS algorithms freely available on the web, but sometimes they are hard to find. This page provides links to them.

= Limits and asymptotic expansion =

The best algorithm is described in the thesis by Gruntz:

http://www.cybertester.com/data/gruntz.pdf

= Polynomials =

Readable article describing factorization (square-free decomposition, Berlekamp's
algorithm), integration of rational functions, summation, Grobner
bases and some other things:

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0209234

See also the Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra below.

= Power series =

State of the art algorithms are described in the "Relax, but don't be too lazy" article:

http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~vdhoeven/Publs/2002/relax4.ps.gz

= Integration =

Article from M. Bronstein describes the Risch algorithm:

A book from the same author:

http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN3540214933&id=8SAaSd89sSkC&dq=Parallel+Integration++M.+Bronstein

can be at least partially viewed here:

http://books.google.com/books?id=8SAaSd89sSkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Parallel+Integration++M.+Bronstein

Another approach is "parallel integration" which is described in the chapter 10 in the above book and also in the article

http://springerlink.metapress.com/content/ag2u372705324332/?p=a75a0e3fbcc444cb9d289aa039bfe212&pi=6

This article 

http://www.ccas.ru/sabramov/ps/PCS56.pdf

says, that it can be implemented in just 100 (!) lines of code.

And here it is -- The Poor Man's Integrator:

= General =

These two sites contain articles concerning almost every aspect of CAS.

http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~vdhoeven/

"A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra" book (available online) contains many algorithms for polynomials, probabilistic primality testing and some other stuff:
