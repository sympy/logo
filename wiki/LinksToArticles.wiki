#summary Contains links to interesting articles about CAS

= Introduction =

There are many nice articles explaining CAS algorithms freely available on the web, but sometimes they are hard to find. This page provides links to them.

= Limits and asymptotic expansion =

The best algorithm is described in the thesis by Gruntz:

= Power series =

State of the art algorithms are described in the "Relax, but don't be too lazy" article:

= Integration =

Article from M. Bronstein describes the Risch algorithm:

A book from the same author:

can be at least partially viewed here:

= General =

These two sites contain articles concerning almost every aspect of CAS.
