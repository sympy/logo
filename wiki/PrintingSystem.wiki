#summary Description of sympy's printing system (starting with 0.4)


Sympy uses a number of formats for printing: pretty printing, latex, mathml and plain string representation. 

= String representation =

This is the standard python representation and is implemented in the classmethod `__str__`

Examples: 

  print 1+x
  print x**2
  etc

= Pretty =
  
   Pretty printing is implemented in the classmethod `__pretty__` and relies on the module sympy.core.stringPict for rendering nice-looking formulas


= MathML =

MathML is the standard for math representation on the web (see http://www.w3.org/Math/)

to see in sympy the mathml code of any object, just type it's mahtml attribute. For example:
{{{
  >>> from sympy import *
  >>> x = Symbol('x')
  >>> (1+x**2).mathml
  '<apply><plus/><cn> 1 </cn><apply><power/><ci> x </ci><cn> 2 </cn></apply></apply>'
}}}

As you can see, MathML is pretty ugly and is not meant to be read directly, that is why there's a module that takes this MathML representation and outputs something more suitable for printing. 

== MathML implementation details ==

conversion to latex and other formats is achieved using xslt stylesheets

Each class has a mathml attribute that returns a string with the mathml code. The  implementation is very nice, and in most classes you only have to define the attribute mathml_tag and it will output the correct mathml code (see classes Symbol, Add, Mul,...) and in some cases you don't have to define anything and it will output the correct mathml (see classes sin, cos, etc.)

For printing, we make use of the modules sympy.modules.mathml (that transforms
the mathml into other formats or into other variants of mathml more suitable for
printing). Currently it transforms mathml content -> mathml presentation and mathml
content -> latex. 

== The mathml module ==

Located in sympy.modules.mathml.

On Debian, install the "python-libxslt1" package.

You don't need to use this module directly, but if you want, use it like this:

{{{
>>> from sympy import *
>>> x = Symbol('x')
>>> from sympy.modules.mathml import mml2latex
>>> print mml2latex( integrate(x*y+1, x, evaluate=False).mathml)
$\int \left(1+yx\right)dx$
}}}


== Printing Module ==

Located in sympy.modules.printing. 


=== Gtk ===

Usage:
{{{
from sympy import *
print_gtk(x**2 + 2*exp(x**3))
}}}


=== Latex ===

Usage:
{{{
>>> from sympy import *
>>> from sympy.modules.printing import *
>>> x = Symbol('x')
>>> f = integrate(exp(x), x, evaluate=False)
>>> print_latex(f)
'$\\int {e}^{x}dx$'
}}}

=== Pygame ===

Usage:
{{{
...
print_pygame(f)
}}}
