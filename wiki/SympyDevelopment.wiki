#summary Development notes

= Introduction =

Sympy development discussion takes place on the mailing list
http://groups.google.com/group/sympy. You can send your patch there, or you can use the issue system.


= Rules =

We have only one rule:

 * As long as all the tests pass, the code is considered fine and can be commited to the svn repository.

This means, that _all_ the functionality that the user expects from a symbolic system need to have a test case. If you implement a new feature, write a test case for it (and as long as this test case passes, the feature is considered to work). If you think there is a bug, write a test case which fails and then fix the bug. 
If you think some other test case should be modified, please discuss it on the mailing list first. 

This also means, that any refactoring is very easy to do, just make sure all the tests run.


= Lists =

Besides the mailing list, there is a list where all issue changes are sent:

http://groups.google.com/group/sympy-issues

So if you want to be notified of any change, subscribe to the list. Then there is a list which receives all subversion commits:
