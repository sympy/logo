#summary How-to on updating the mpmath install in SymPy.

*Note: this needs more detailed information*

An announcement will be sent to the sympy mailing list whenever mpmath is updated.  When this happens, the mpmath that is included with SymPy needs to be updated.  

You can obtain the new mpmath from http://code.google.com/p/mpmath/.  

You need to copy the new mpmath into sympy/mpmath, then use:

bin/adapt_paths.py

(just read the module docstring for more info) and then run tests and
see if everything works, usually then one has to fix some little bugs.
