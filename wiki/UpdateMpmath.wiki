#summary How-to on updating the mpmath install in SymPy.

*Note: this needs more detailed information*

An announcement will be sent to the sympy mailing list whenever mpmath is updated.  When this happens, the mpmath that is included with SymPy needs to be updated.  

  * You can obtain the new mpmath from http://code.google.com/p/mpmath/.  
  
  * You need to copy the new mpmath into sympy/mpmath.
  
  * Use:

{{{
python bin/adapt_paths.py > /tmp/x
patch -p0 < /tmp/x
}}}
to fix the import statements in the mpmath tests.  Read the docstring of adapt_paths.py for more info.

  * Run {{{./bin/strip_whitespace sympy/mpmath/ --recursive}}} to fix carriage returns in the mpmath source files.  {{{./bin/test sympy/utilities/tests/test_code_quality.py}}} will verify that everything is fixed here.

  * Run tests and see if everything works, usually then one has to fix some little bugs.

  * If everything works, submit a patch.
