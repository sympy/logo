#summary Information about sympycore

= Introduction =

!SymPy uses a development model as described in SympyDevelopment, basically tests must pass and everything should be discussed in Issues, that is very good for a mature project, but on the other hand makes it very difficult to easily resolve some fundamental issues, such as speed, assumptions model, caching issues etc.

Nobody knows what is the best way to resolve these issues,
therefore one must experiment and that may temporarily break lots of
code. This is not reasonable with the current state of !SymPy. 
As a rule, fixing fundamental issues require fundamental changes.

We think it is time to start implementing them. We started to play with new ideas in sympy-sandbox branch, but a new project sympycore is a better place to do it, because some of the code can be already useful to other people.
