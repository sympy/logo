#summary Information about sympycore

= Introduction =

!SymPy uses a development model as described in SympyDevelopment, basically tests must pass and everything should be discussed in Issues, that is very good for a mature project and 
I (Ond≈ôej) very stronly believe that is the way to go - team work, open discussion about everything, cooperation. 

There are issues that could be improved though, such as speed, assumptions model, caching issues etc.

Nobody knows what is the best way to resolve these issues,
therefore one must experiment and that may temporarily break lots of
code. Thus such development needs to happen in a separate branch. We started to play with new ideas in the sympy-sandbox branch mainly by Pearu Peterson, but later Pearu decided to create his own project [http://code.google.com/p/sympycore sympycore], which has basically evolved into a fork of !SymPy.

Our plan in !SymPy is to see which ideas are good and which are bad in sympycore, let it settle for a while and then discuss them in Issues and implementing the good ones in !SymPy.  We believe that the way to go is incremental improvements of !SymPy, not a rewrite from scratch - we did that once in August 2006 and it broke a lot of things (some of which aren't working till now, but also some other things started to work), so that's not the way to go.
We also believe that having two incompatible symbolic manipulation libraries in Python is a bad thing. It's sad that sympycore developers don't implement the things directly in !SymPy, so that we need to duplicate their work in many cases, but we will port all good things finally, it will just take longer.

With our strategy, !SymPy will always work and also it will benefit from new fundamental improvements.
