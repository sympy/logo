#summary Information about sympycore

= Introduction =

!SymPy uses a development model as described in SympyDevelopment, basically tests must pass and everything should be discussed in Issues, that is very good for a mature project and 
I (Ondřej) very stronly believe that is the way to go - team work, open discussion about everything, cooperation. 

There are issues that could be improved though, such as speed, assumptions model, caching issues etc.

Nobody knows what is the best way to resolve these issues,
therefore one must experiment and that may temporarily break lots of
code. Thus such development needs to happen in a separate branch. This is done by Pearu Peterson in the sympycore project.
We think it is time to start implementing them, in parallel of implementing new features in !SymPy. We started to play with new ideas in sympy-sandbox branch, but Pearu decided to create his own project [http://code.google.com/p/sympycore sympycore].

My (Ondřej) plan is to see which ideas are good and which are bad in sympycore, let it settle for a while and then discuss them in Issues and implementing the good ones in !SymPy. 

That way !SymPy will always work and also it will benefit from new fundamental improvements.
