!SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. !SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries, except optionally for plotting support.

!SymPy is easy to install and get started with. See the [DownloadInstallation download instructions] for more information.

==News==

  * *12 Apr 2007* The Google Summer of Code applications results are available. See [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/GSoC2007 GSoC2007]
  * *25 Mar 2007* Version 0.3 released. Look at [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Changes changes] since the last release.
  * *15 Mar 2007* We are accepting applications for the Google Summer of Code, see SummerOfCode. Deadline is March 26th.
  * *12 Mar 2007* Version 0.2 released.

==Features==

Currently, !SymPy core has only around 1500 lines of code (including extensive comments) and its capabilities include:

  * basic arithmetics `*,/,+,-`
  * basic simplification (like `a*b*b + 2*b*a*b  -> 3*a*b^2`)
  * expansion (like `(a+b)^2 -> a^2 + 2*a*b + b^2`)
  * functions (exp, ln, sin, cos, tan, ...)
  * complex numbers (like `exp(I*x).evalc()  -> cos(x)+I*sin(x)`)
  * differentiation
  * taylor series
  * basic substitution (like x-> ln(x))
  * arbitrary precision integers, rationals and floats
  * noncommutative symbols
 
Then there are !SymPy modules (1000 lines) for these tasks:

  * limits (like `limit(x*log(x), x, 0) -> 0`)
  * integration (currently it can only do very simple integrals)
  * polynomials (division, gcd, square free decomposition)
  * symbolic matrices
  * Pauli and Dirac algebra


===Things we are working on===
 
  * Implement featues of GiNaC that !SymPy cannot yet do (we are almost there)
  * See [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/list Issues] for details and other things

===Some ideas for future development===

  * implement factorisation, Risch integration algorithm (see our [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/SymbolicIntegration notes]), asymptotic expansion, equations solving, linear algebra, objects with indices (tensors) and more...

==Documentation==

All the documentation is in the wiki [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Documentation Documentation].

==Motivation==

Why another CAS? What is the !SymPy's relationship to SAGE?

Everything is explained in the [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Motivation Motivation].

==Usage==

Example in the python interpreter:

>>> from sympy import Symbol, cos
>>> x=Symbol('x')
>>> e=1/cos(x)
>>> print e.series(x,10)
1+1/2*x**2+O(x**10)+5/24*x**4+61/720*x**6+277/8064*x**8

There is a nice console `isympy` (in the `bin` directory, or if you installed the `deb`, it will be in `/usr/bin/isympy`) which just imports sympy and defines symbols x,y,z for you, so the above thing can be achieved by starting `isympy` and typing this one line:
{{{
(1/cos(x)).series(x,10)
}}}

==Development==

You are welcomed to join the development. If you find a bug or just want to say what you think, tell us on the [http://groups.google.com/group/sympy mailinglist]. We are interested in your opinions if you think the !SymPy's interface is not
as you would expect or if you created some algorithm using !SymPy and would like it to become part of !SymPy (so that others can easily use your code as well).

More information can be found in SympyDevelopment.
