from http://www.ccas.ru/sabramov/ps/PCS56.pdf:

The results of his
work in this area included a new version of the algo-
rithm of parallel integration (the ﬁrst versions of the
algorithm of parallel integration were proposed in the
late 1970s and early 1980s by A. Norman, P. Moore,
and J. Davenport; here, the term “parallel” does not
relate to multiprocessor execution, and Manuel sug-
gested replacing this term with “ﬂat integration”). In
general, this algorithm is not as powerful as the com-
plete version of the Risch—Bronstein algorithm for
symbolic integration; however, it may be implemented
in just a hundred lines of code. A note on the algorithm
of parallel integration is published in this issue of Pro-
gramming and Computer Software. This note is an
extended abstract of Manuel’s talk at the joint seminar
on computer algebra of the MSU and JINR (Joint Insti-
tute for Nuclear Research) in Dubna on May 18, 2005.
