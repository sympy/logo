#summary Examples of most features of sympy

= Introduction =

We tried to create an example for most of the features of sympy. Currently, this also the only documentation to sympy.

You can find all the following examples in the `examples` directory as regular python scripts. More examples can be found in the tests directory in form of the testing suite.


= Basic manipulation =

{{{
>>> import sym
>>> a=sym.symbol('a')
>>> b=sym.symbol('b')
>>> c=sym.symbol('c')
>>> e=( a*b*b+2*b*a*b )**c
>>> print e
((a*b)*b+((2*b)*a)*b)^c
>>> print e.eval()
3^c*a^c*b^(2*c)
}}}

= Series expansion = 

{{{
>>> import sym
>>> x=sym.symbol('x')
>>> e=1/sym.cos(x)
>>> print e.series(x,10)
1+50521/3628800*x^10+61/720*x^6+277/8064*x^8+1/2*x^2+5/24*x^4
}}}
