#summary Information about the 2007 Google Summer of Code and SymPy

= Introduction =

Five students were accepted for GSoC 2007. You can find here who their mentor was, which organisation they were working for, their final reports and tutorials (documentation) to their projects. Besides that, they helped to fix many things all over !SymPy and just brought !SymPy where it is now.

Overall, it was a success and we will try participate in GSoC 2008 as well. It will be announced on the front page if we do (and even if we don't), so just follow the news on the front page.

You can also find links to the individual blogs there. There are many interesting information in there about what was happening during the summer.

Besides that, the sympy's mailinglist and issues are the other two areas, where the development was taking place. See also SympyDevelopment.
