#summary Motivation to work on sympy

= Introduction =

The motivation to work on sympy is given on the main page (http://code.google.com/p/sympy/) in the section Motivation. 

Here are some ideas where sympy could be effectively used.

= Geometry =

Write a geometry module, which you would tell: create a triangle, construct angle bisectors, a circumcircle etc. And then you would ask questions: do these three lines intersect? Is this point in that line? 

The module will use an analytic geometry to represent the geometry entities (lines, triangles, points, ...) and then solve symbolic equations to answer the questions.

= Other =

All the things which are written as Mathematica or Maple modules, for a real world example, look at 
http://www.feyncalc.org/ for doing quantum field theory (QFT) calculations.
