== Installation ==

 - debian

 - source

 - windows

== What you'll need to follow this tutorial ==

 - isympy: all examples are made within isympy. If you can't run isympy, then you'll have to run the following code at the beginning of each session: 

{{{
   >>> from isympy import *
   >>> x = Symbol('x')
   >>> y = Symbol('y')
   >>> z = Symbol('z')
}}}

= Using SymPy as a calculator =

Sympy has two built-in numeric types: [http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/api/sympy.core.numbers.Real-class.html Real] and [http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/api/sympy.core.numbers.Rational-class.html Rational]. 

The Rational class represents a rational number as a pair of two integers: the numerator and the denominator, so Rational(1,2) represents 1/2, Rational(5,2) 5/2 and so on. 

{{{
  In [0]: a = Rational(1,2)

  In [1]: a
  Out[1]: 1/2

  In [2]: a*2
  Out[2]: 1
}}}

proceed with caution while working with python int's since they truncate integer division, and that's why: 

{{{
   In [2]: 1/2
   Out[2]: 0

   In [3]: 1.0/2
   Out[3]: 0.5

}}}

= Matrices =

Matrices are created as instances from the [http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/api/sympy.modules.matrices.Matrix-class.html Matrix] class: 

{{{
In [13]: Matrix([[1,0],[0,1]])
Out[13]: 
1 0 
0 1 
}}}

you can also put Symbols in it: 
{{{
In [15]: A = Matrix([[1,x],[y,1]])

In [16]: A
Out[16]: 
1 x 
y 1 

In [17]: A**2
Out[17]: 
1+y*x 2*x 
2*y 1+y*x 
}}}
