#summary How to work with setup.py

= Introduction =

This wiki describes how to work with setup.py. Help:
{{{
./setup.py --help-commands
}}}
This will print a summary of all commands that `setup.py` understands.

= Cleaning =

To clean the sources (so that `svn st` returns nothing), do 
{{{
./setup.py clean
}}}

= Man page =

The man page is in `doc/man/isympy.1`, and it is generated from the file `doc/man/isympy.xml`. To edit it, edit just the file `doc/man/isympy.xml` and then rebuild the man page with

{{{
  docbook2x-man doc/man/isympy.xml
  mv isympy.1 doc/man/isympy.1
}}}


= Generating the (html) documentation for the api =

You'll need epydoc (wajig install python-epydoc). (The output is written to ../api/ (you can change this editing the variable gen_doc.target_dir ))

{{{
svn checkout https://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/ sympy --username ondrej.certik
cd sympy/trunk
./setup.py gen_doc
cd ../api
svn propset svn:mime-type text/html *.html
svn ci
}}}

= How to make a new release =

Create a new branch:

{{{
svn checkout https://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/ sympy --username ondrej.certik
cd sympy
svn copy trunk tags/sympy-0.4
}}}

Then in this branch:

{{{
./setup.py sdist
}}}

and put the dist/sympy-0.4-pre.tar.gz on the website.
