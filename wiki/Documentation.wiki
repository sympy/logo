= Main documentation =

If you are new to !SymPy, start with the [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Tutorial Tutorial].

Then read the driving ideas behind !SymPy that are described in HowItWorks.

And finally, read the [http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sources] itself or just the [http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/api/index.html API] documentation, that is automatically generated from the sources. Because every feature of !SymPy must have a test case, when you are not sure how to use something, just look into the `tests/` directory, find that feature and read the tests for it, that will tell you everything you need to know.

Documentation for individual modules is provided in the following pages:

  * [GeometryModule Geometry Module]
  * [LinearAlgebraTutorial Linear Algebra Module]
  * [NumericsModule Numerics Module]
  * [PlottingModule Plotting Module]
  * [ConcreteMathAndTermRewriting Concrete Mathematics Module]
  * [PolynomialsTutorial Polynomials Module]
  * [StatisticsModule Statistics Module]
