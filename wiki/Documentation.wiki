= Introduction =

This is the central page for all documentation to !SymPy.

= Download & Installation =

For all instructions how to download and install !SymPy, see DownloadInstallation.

= Main documentation =

If you are new to !SymPy, start with the [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Tutorial Tutorial].

Then browse the documentation of individual !SymPy modules:

  * [GeometryModule Geometry Module]
  * [LinearAlgebraTutorial Linear Algebra Module]
  * [NumericsModule Numerics Module]
  * [PlottingModule Plotting Module]
  * [ConcreteMathAndTermRewriting Concrete Mathematics Module]
  * [PolynomialsTutorial Polynomials Module]
  * [StatisticsModule Statistics Module]
  * [PrintingSystem Printing System]

Then read the driving ideas behind !SymPy that are described in HowItWorks.

And finally, read the [http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sources] itself or just the [http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/api/index.html API] documentation, that is automatically generated from the sources (at this moment, September 19, 2007, the API doc is old, because epydoc 3.0 doesn't work with the current sympy, see the [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=318 issue 318]). Because every feature of !SymPy must have a test case, when you are not sure how to use something, just look into the `tests/` directory, find that feature and read the tests for it, that will tell you everything you need to know.

= Other =

Presentations about !SymPy given at conferences are at SymPyPresentations.

Useful information can also be found on our blog [http://planet.sympy.org/ Planet SymPy].

You may want to look at [GSoC2007 2007 Google Summer of Code in SymPy] and join in 2008. :)

!SymPy logos: SymPyLogos.

You are welcomed to join (or just follow) the development. SympyDevelopment describes the details, with links to places that you should watch.
