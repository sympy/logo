==== Separation of Calculation and Display Code ====

2D and 3D calculation is a pattern that should be factored out of PlotCurve, PlotSurface, and the corresponding color calculation functions.

==== Support for Dynamic Level-of-Detail ====

In other words, be able to recalculate the display vertices for different zoom levels and perspectives dynamically, rather than calculating them once when the function is added to the plot.
