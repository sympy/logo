#summary Description of sympy's printing system (since 0.3)

= Introduction =

The new printing system depends heavily on MathML

MathML is the standard for math representation on the web (see http://www.w3.org/Math/)

to see in sympy the mathml code of any object, just type it's mahtml attribute. For example:
{{{
  >>> from sympy import *
  >>> x = Symbol('x')
  >>> (1+x**2).mathml
  '<apply><plus/><cn> 1 </cn><apply><power/><ci> x </ci><cn> 2 </cn></apply></apply>'
}}}

conversion to latex and other formats is achieved using xslt stylesheets

Each class has a mathml attribute that returns a string with the mathml code. The  implementation is very nice, and in most classes you only have to define the attribute mathml_tag and it will output the correct mathml code (see classes Symbol, Add, Mul,...) and in some cases you don't have to define anything and it will output the correct mathml (see classes sin, cos, etc.)

For printing, we make use of the modules sympy.modules.mathml (that transforms
the mathml into other formats or into other variants of mathml more suitable for
printing). Currently it transforms mathml content -> mathml presentation and mathml
content -> latex.
