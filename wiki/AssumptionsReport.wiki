#summary Review of the 2009 Summer of Code project

= Introduction =

The main goals in my project are to build a new assumption system. By an assumption system I mean a module that can extract conclusions from assumptions and known facts. My module should have the following qualities:

  - It should be out of the core, and the core should not have any dependencies on this.
  - It should be easily extensible.
  - It should have a nice user interface.
  - It should be fast.


= First steps =

In the month of march I had some initial code for a new assumption system. It depended heavily on sympy.core.facts and was rather slow, but that served as a model for future work. It already had some nice ideas: all computations where done in modules that got imported at runtime and thus there was no overhead at load time (as opposed to the old system).


= Facing some problems =

In the initial implementation of the module is that it made extensive use of sympy.core.facts, and that module was extremely difficult to extend. It is necessary to implement a new logic and facts module. At that point I discussed the problem with Ondrej Certik and he suggested that it would be a nice Summer of Code Project.

= GSoC =

The first thing to do was to implement a new logic module.
