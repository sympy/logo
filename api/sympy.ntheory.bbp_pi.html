Modifications:
1.Once the nth digit is selected the number of digits of working precision is
caluclated to ensure that the 14 Hexidecimal representation of that region is
accurate. This was found eimperically to be int((math.log10(n//1000))+18).
This was found by searching for a value of working precision for the n = 0 and
n = 1 then n was increased untill the result was less precise, therefore increased again
this was repeated for increasing n and an effective fit was found between n and
the working precision value.

2. The while loop to evaluate whether the series has convergered has be replaced
with a fixed for loop, that option was selected because in a very large number of
cases the loop convereged to a point where no difference can be detected in less than
15 iterations. (done for more accurate memory and time banking).

3. output hex string constrained to 14 characters (accuarcy assured to n = 10**7)

4. pi_hex_digits(n) changed to have coeffiecient to the formula in an array (perhaps just
a matter of preference).</pre></div><table class="children"><tr class="function"><td>Function</td><td><a href="#sympy.ntheory.bbp_pi.Series">Series</a></td><td><span class="undocumented">Undocumented</span></td></tr><tr class="function"><td>Function</td><td><a href="#sympy.ntheory.bbp_pi.pi_hex_digits">pi_hex_digits</a></td><td><span class="undocumented">Undocumented</span></td></tr><tr class="function"><td>Function</td><td><a href="#sympy.ntheory.bbp_pi.dn">dn</a></td><td><span class="undocumented">Undocumented</span></td></tr></table>
